My name is Qiushi Guo. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2016, and my master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from TU Kaiserslautern in 2020. During my master's studies, I interned at DFKI, where I worked on deep learning-based remote sensing image processing and magnetic field-based indoor localization. After graduation, I worked at the AI Lab of China Merchants Bank and later at CSRD, focusing on face recognition and railway obstacle detection and warning.





How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
