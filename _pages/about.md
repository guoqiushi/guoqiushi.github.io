My name is Qiushi Guo. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC) in 2016, and my master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from TU Kaiserslautern in 2020. During my master's studies, I interned at DFKI, where I worked on deep learning-based remote sensing image processing and magnetic field-based indoor localization. After graduation, I worked at the AI Lab of China Merchants Bank and later at CSRD, focusing on face recognition and railway obstacle detection and warning.

Feel free to contact me.
